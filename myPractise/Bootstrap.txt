LISTING CAUROSEL
Bootstrap has predefined classes that canbe used on row elements to align the column elements withi them. the following are some of the few
- justify-content-center (centers the columns)
- justify-content-start (left-justifies the columns)
- justify-content-end (right-justifies the columns)
- justify-around-end (spaces the columns evenly)
- justify-between-end (puts all the available space between the two columns

The following are some classes to use on the column elements in order to align contents  within them
- align-self-start (will force that specific cell's content to the top of the cell)
- align-self-end (will force that specific cell's content to the bottom of the cell)
- align-self-center (will force that specific cell's content to the vertical center of the cell)
--> The class name for the general column layout is <div class="clo-x"></div>

---> In order to make the grid responsive, Bootstrap has included the ability for us to
tweak the classes by adding a symbol to the class name between the col and the x (that is,an integer from 1 to 12).
eg. <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-3" >

BOOTSTRAP COMPONENTS
1. Button Components
-Example is as shown below
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Click me</button>
That button is blue in color, but there are other default colors we have access to via these
other classes:
-> btn-secondary: Light charcoal gray, with white font
-> btn-success: Light green, with white font
-> btn-danger: Red, with white font
-> btn-warning: Goldenrod, with black font
-> btn-info: Teal, with white font
-> btn-light: Light gray, with black font 
-> btn-dark: Almost black, with white font
-> btn-link: turns a button into a link

Bootstrap has a set ofclasses that match the preceding classes called Outline buttons. 
The colors and class names are the same, with the only difference being the word outline between btn and secondary,success, danger, and so on. 
The buttons are transparent except for the outline, or border, and
of course, the font color for the text on the button.
Here's what the classes look like
-> btn-outline-secondary: Light charcoal gray outline, with the same color for the font
-> btn-outline-success: Light green outline, with the same color for the font
-> btn-outline-danger: Red outline, with the same color for the font
-> btn-outline-warning: Goldenrod outline, with the same color for the font
-> btn-outline-info: Teal outline, with the same color for the font
-> btn-outline-light: Light gray outline, with the same color for the font
-> btn-outline-dark: Almost black outline, with the same color for the font

Bootstrap has a way in which to make the default button larger or
smaller by adding the .btn-lg or .btn-sm class, respectively. Here is what that would look like:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">I'm large</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">I'm small</button>

2. Alert Components
For the most part, their coloring and naming scheme is fairly consistent with the button components.
Here are the alerts that are available:
--> <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">This is a primary alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">This is a secondary alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">This is a success alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">This is a danger alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">This is a warning alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">This is a info alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">This is a light alert</div>
--> <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">This is a dark alert</div>

3. Navbar Component
Bootstrap's way to give you a nicely styled navigation bar across the top of your web page.
These include the following:
-> .navbar-brand for your company, product, or project name
-> .navbar-nav for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns)
-> .navbar-toggler for use with our collapse plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors
-> .form-inline for any form controls and actions
-> .navbar-text for adding vertically centered strings of text
-> .collapse.navbar-collapse for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint

creating lightboxes, user notifications, and more.

NAV - section
Implementing a nav tag element and using the Bootstrap navbar classes, navbar-default, navbar-fixed-top, navbar-brand, navbar-collapse, and so on. 
These classes come with default functionality that covers almost all aspects of a navigation section. 
One of the interesting things to note is the navbar-collapse class, which helps in rendering various device screen resolutions automatically.
